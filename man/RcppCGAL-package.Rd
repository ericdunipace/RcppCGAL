\title{RcppCGAL: Rcpp Integration for CGAL}
\description{
Creates a header only package to link to the CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) header files in Rcpp. There are a variety of potential uses for the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors, and convex hull algorithms. There is only one R function in this package, which returns the current version of the CGAL library included. For more information about how to use the header files, see the CGAL documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>. Currently includes the CGAL 5.3.1 stable release.

# To use this in a C++ file make sure you add an appropriate
# dependency in your header C++ code. Make sure to use CGAL/basic.h

#include <Rcpp.h>
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppCGAL)]]
#include <CGAL/basic.h>

// function code
