Description: Creates a header only package to link to the CGAL 
  (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
  header files in Rcpp. There are a variety of potential uses for 
  the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors, 
  and convex hull algorithms. For more information about how to use the header files, 
  see the CGAL documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>. Currently
  downloads the CGAL version 5.6 from GitHub.
