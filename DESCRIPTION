Description: Creates a header only package to link to the CGAL header files in Rcpp <https://www.cgal.org>. There are a variety of potential uses for the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors, and convex hull algorithms. There is only one R function in this package, which returns the current version of the CGAL library included. For more information about how to use the header files, see the CGAL documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>.
