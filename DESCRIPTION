Author: Eric Dunipace
Maintainer: Eric Dunipace <edunipace@mail.harvard.edu>
Description: Creates a header only package to link to the CGAL 
  (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
  header files in Rcpp. There are a variety of potential uses for 
  the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors, 
  and convex hull algorithms. There is only one R function in this 
  package, which returns the current version of the CGAL library 
  included. For more information about how to use the header files, 
  see the CGAL documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>. Currently 
  includes CGAL 5.3.1 stable release. Note: This software is GPL3+
  but the CGAL header files are dual licensed.
  The CGAL group requests that if you are using CGAL for
  a commercial purpose, that you obtain a commercial license
  for the CGAL software. 
  See <https://www.cgal.org/license.html> for more details.
