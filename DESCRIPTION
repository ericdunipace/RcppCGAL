Description: Creates a header only package to link to the CGAL 
  (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
  header files in Rcpp. There are a variety of potential uses for 
  the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors, 
  and convex hull algorithms. There is only one R function in this 
  package, which returns the current version of the CGAL library 
  included. For more information about how to use the header files, 
  see the CGAL documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>. Currently 
  includes the CGAL 5.3.1 stable release.
