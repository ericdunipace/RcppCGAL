  (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
  header files in 'Rcpp'. There are a variety of potential uses for 
  the software such as Hilbert sorting, K-D Tree nearest neighbors, 
  and convex hull algorithms. For more information about how to use the header files, 
  see the 'CGAL' documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>. Currently
