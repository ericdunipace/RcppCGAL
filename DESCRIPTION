Title: Rcpp Integration for CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
Version: 5.2.1

Maintainer: Eric Dunipace <edunipace@mail.harvard.edu>
Description: Creates a header only package to link to the CGAL 
  header files in Rcpp. There are a variety of potential uses for 
  the software such as Hilbert sorting, KDtree nearest neighbors, 
  and convex hull algorithms. There is only one R function in this 
  package, which returns the current version of the CGAL library 
  included. For more information about how to use the header files, 
  see the CGAL documentation at <https://www.cgal.org>. Currently 
  includes CGAL 5.2.1 stable release. Note: if you wish to use CGAL 
  for a non-GPLv3+ purpose, then you MUST obtain a commercial license 
  for CGAL. See <https://www.cgal.org/license.html> for more details. 
  Also, be aware that some files in the CGAL directory have names that 
  are too long to put into the package on CRAN. 
  To obtain a version of the
  package that does not remove these files, see the
  github version at <https://github.com/ericdunipace/RcppCGAL>.
